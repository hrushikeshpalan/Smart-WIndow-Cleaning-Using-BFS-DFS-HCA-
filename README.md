# Smart-WIndow-Cleaning-Using-BFS-DFS-HCA-
Smart Window cleaning simulation is a part of a wider topic “Smart Homes and Automation’. It talks about a part where we create an agent which acquires information based on sensors and proceeds with cleaning the given frame according to search and optimisation algorithms.In our simulation we have created a GUI using the tkinter library of python. 
Our project aims to use AI to simulate a window cleaning service robot in large buildings. It uses sensors to provide us with dirt heuristics that we have further used in implementing our program. Moreover, Breadth-First search, Depth-First search and Hill climb algorithms are also used. Tests validate ORB's desired results in feature point extraction, demonstrating how AI and SLAM may improve the productivity and security of robots that clean windows on irregular surfaces.

Blue frame is a matrix of 800x600 blocks. Dirts are rectangles of 20x20. Cleaning agent is a rectangle with 20x20.  

Now we will simulate all the 3 algos one by one. First we go with DFS.(woth code runthrugh).
